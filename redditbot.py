I used to use them genuinely, but as time went on I found myself meaning it less every time I used them. How many people actually laugh out loud when they say "LOL," laugh their ass off when they say "LMAO," and roll on the floor laughing when they say "ROFL"? No one. This is the result of the pathetic world of lies we live in. As my depression grew stronger over the years I found myself questioning the true meaning of these acronyms when I used them. I decided they represent the mask of anonymous lies we live behind on the internet and since they are lies it makes sense that the user is experiencing the opposite emotion of what they actually express. I used these "humorous" acronyms on a layer of irony for several more years but no one noticed. No one paid attention to my wounded calls for help, my desperate cries for relief from this horrible life. I now seek to solve this problem on my own instead of relying on the cruel, heartless "humans" that dominate society today. Tonight I solve the problem once and for all, by ending my trial on the hell we call "earth."
